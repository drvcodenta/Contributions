## Overview
Open-source IT and security project for teams to monitor security flaws in the devices of the IT Teams

### Why do I like this project?
I came across many projects during my open-source journey.
The most important thing that acted as a fuel for me being engaged in the community was people.
Whatever projects I had been able to contribute to had great people and great communication.
There were many projects where the reply never even came, even after months.

This is the exact reason why Fleet stood out. The people here â€” especially Scott and Ian â€” are incredibly supportive. Replies come within a day (sometimes even in seconds ðŸ™Œ).
